# challenge a: unclustering digits

Your supercluster usually crunches numbers like nobody's business: Each of the ten nodes processes one digit of the job and sends it back to the main computer to re-assemble.

But today something's gone wrong! Instead of reassembling the digits, the main computer just spits out an array of single-digit integers.

Your team has been commissioned to convert a list of digits back into a number.
