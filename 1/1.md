1. IO
2. Variables
3. Functions

# Input and Output

Simple example:

```python
print("Hello world!")
```

---

# Input and Output

Simple example:

```python
print("Hello" + "world!")
```

---

# Input and Output

Simple example:

```python
print("Hello" + "world!")
```

```
Helloworld!
```

---

# Input and Output

Simple example:

```python
print("Hello " + "world!")
```

---

# Input and Output

Simple example:

```python
print("Hello " + "Ron!")
```

---

# Input and Output

If we want to say hello to an arbitrary name, we can assign that name to a variable:

```python
my_name = "Jordan"
```

Assignment only works from "right to left":

```python
number_of_fingers = 10 # this works :)
10 = number_of_fingers # THIS DOES NOT WORK :(
```

---

# Input and Output

```python
my_name = "Jordan"
print("Hello " + my_name + "!")
```

> Hello Jordan!

---

# Variables

There are different sorts of variables:

```python
value = 1             # integer

value = 3.14159       # float

value = "Bamboozle!"  # string

value = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # list
```

There are other types of variables as well â€” but you can look that up.

---

# Variables: Types of Numbers

Strings and lists can be accessed "by-item". These arrays are zero-indexed: That means that the first *element* is at position 0.

```python
value = [1, 3, 3, 7]
print(value[0])
print(value[1])
```

> 1
> 3

You can also access elements in reverse:

```python
value = [1, 3, 3, 7]
print(value[-1])
```

> 7

# A note

Use the internet and the [Python documentation](docs.python.org) to learn about conditionals ("if"-statements): The tubes will do a better job of teaching you these things than I will! But feel free to use the code in this presentation as an example.

# Functions

Just like in math, Python supports "functions":

```
y = m * x + b
```

```python
def y(m, x, b):
    return m * x + b
```

---

# Functions

```python
def say_hello(name):
    print("Hello " + name)
```

"Call" functions with parentheses like you'd call them in math:

> f(x)

```python
say_hello("Jordan")
```

> "Hello Jordan"
