# Getting Started
> Docker uniform-izes your "environment". You may want to skip this if you feel comfortable running these commands on your Mac or Unix computer. (Windows users: If you don't feel confident running bash commands, install Docker!)

- Docker [docker.io]

# Run a Docker Container

First, create a directory in which to save your work:

<!-- TODO: Need to not 777 this... -->
```shell
$ mkdir ubuntu_volume/
$ sudo chmod 777 ubuntu_volume/
```

```shell
$ docker run -p 8888:8888 \
  -v $(pwd)/ubuntu_volume:/home/jovyan/work \
  jupyter/datascience-notebook \
  start-notebook.sh
```

The last line of this installation should say something like:

> Navigate to localhost:8888/...

Copy that URL and put it in your browser.

## Jupyter Notebooks

If you see the page below, congratulations! You've created a Jupyter Notebook.

<!-- TODO: screenshot a notebook here -->

Jupyter notebooks are like lab notebooks for code: You can run code in the notebook, see the results, and save the parts you like.

This lets other people see what code you ran, and on which data. #reproducible!
